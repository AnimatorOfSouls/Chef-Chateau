# Chef Chateau
Aha, so you're new head chef? Well, you'll be in charge of making the food for everyone in this castle. What do you mean you're not ready? I've been waiting for this moment for ages, no way am I going to keep working here. So long, suckers, retirement here I come!

## Gameplay
Gather ingredients from the farm or buy them from the market.

Cook different kinds of food in the kitchen.

Sell your food to the residents of the castle to make money.
